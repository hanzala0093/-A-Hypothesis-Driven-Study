# 🚖 Maximizing Taxi Driver Revenue Using Payment Method Insights 💳💵

## 📌 Problem Statement
In the competitive taxi industry, maximizing revenue is vital for driver success 🚖💰.  
This project explores whether the choice of payment method (cash or card) affects total fare amounts.  
Using NYC Taxi Trip data 📊, we aim to uncover insights to encourage higher-revenue payment methods without hurting customer experience.

## 🔍 Solution Approach
We followed a data-driven process to reveal key patterns between payment types and fare amounts:

- **🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Focused on key features: `passenger_count`, `payment_type`, `fare_amount`, `trip_distance`, and `duration`.

- **📊 Descriptive Analysis**  
  Summarized important metrics like fare averages and customer payment preferences.

- **🧪 Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)**  
  Tested if fare amounts significantly differ between card and cash payments.

- **📈 Regression Analysis**  
  Analyzed how trip duration relates to fare amount to strengthen findings.

## 📈 Key Findings
- 💳 Card users tend to take longer trips and pay higher fares compared to cash users.
- 📈 67.5% of customers prefer paying with cards due to convenience and security.
- 👥 Single-passenger rides are most common, especially with card payments.
- 🧪 Hypothesis testing confirmed a significant fare difference between payment methods.

## ✅ Recommendations
- 🎁 Offer incentives or discounts for credit card payments.
- 🔒 Ensure seamless and secure card transaction options.
- 🎯 Encourage card payments to boost driver earnings and satisfaction.
